Envelop
Erich Blume

This is an ansible project to deploy my development environment and dotfiles.
Use it as a jumping off point for your own work, as this is highly customized
to my own setup.

To run, first bootstrap with:

    ./bin/bootstrap_{debian,osx}  # use the proper version for your OS
    ./bin/link_paths /etc/ansible  # instead of /etc/ansible you can use any config directory you want, but /etc/ansible is the common default.

Then, edit at minimum the following files to ensure they match your setup (you
should audit all files though):

    ./host_vars/{your_machine_hostname}.yaml
    ./playbooks/provision.yaml
    ./roles/common/tasks/personal_dev.yaml  # you probably don't want my personal projects, you probably want your own. Your call. :)

If you don't want to use the fish shell, you'll need to edit the following
files:

    ./roles/common/tasks/main.yml  # You'll want to remove 'install_fish.yml'
    ./roles/common/tasks/install_pyenv.yml  # You'll want to remove the kludge I have in place to invoke fish on all of those installs for poetry
    ./roles/common/taskks/install_ctags.yml  # Same here, you'll need to remove the fish invocation for docutils

Finally, to run envelop's provisioning agent, use:

    ./run_local.sh --ask-become-pass  # you can remove --ask-become-pass if you have password-less SUDO enabled
